  1.  The vector3D class follows Open Close Principle: The vector3D class is designed in such a way that it is open to
      extensions but closed to modifications. The main code of the class does not have to be modified to extend it to
      other features like vector rotations etc.

  2.  Ooperator Overloading is used. It is a type of polymorphism in which an operator is overloaded to give user
      defined meaning to it.
      Here, the operators like '+', '*' are overloaded to utilise it for addition of vectors and scalar multiplication
      respectively.

  3.  Flexible, non-fragile and mobile code
